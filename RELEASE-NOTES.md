# Zeem — Initial Release (v0.1.0)

Welcome! Zeem helps you automatically join and leave Zoom meetings on a weekly schedule. Set it once and let it handle the routine.

## What Zeem does

- Weekly meeting schedule
  - Add meetings with: title, Zoom link, weekday, start time, and end time
  - Enable/disable any meeting without deleting it
- Auto-join before start
  - Zeem automatically opens Zoom and joins your next scheduled meeting a few minutes before it starts
- Auto-leave at end time
  - When the meeting window ends, Zeem leaves the meeting for you
- One‑click Join/Leave
  - Use the buttons to manually join the next meeting or leave the current one anytime
- Live status panel
  - See what’s Ongoing and what’s Upcoming in the sidebar, with a live clock
- Works in the background
  - Close the main window—Zeem keeps the schedule running until you quit the app
- Automatic updates
  - Zeem checks for updates automatically and installs them for you (when available)

## Getting started

1) Install
- Run the installer (Zeem-0.1.0-Setup.exe) and follow the prompts.

2) Add your meetings
- Click “+ Add Meeting”
- Paste your Zoom link, choose the weekday, and set the start and end times
- Save. Repeat for any other meetings

3) Enable meetings
- Make sure each meeting you want Zeem to manage is enabled

4) Let Zeem handle it
- Leave the app running. Zeem will:
  - Join shortly before the start time
  - Launch Zoom when needed (if it isn’t already running)
  - Leave at the scheduled end time

## Tips

- Manual control: Click “Join Meeting” from the sidebar any time, or use “Leave” inside the app to drop early.
- Disabled meetings: Keep a meeting in your list but turn it off temporarily—handy during holidays or changes.
- Time format: Times use your system settings (12/24‑hour). If it looks off, check your OS time settings.

## Troubleshooting

- Zoom doesn’t open or join
  - Check the Zoom link in the meeting is correct.
  - Try joining manually once, then reopen Zeem.
- Meeting didn’t auto‑leave
  - Double‑check the end time set for the meeting.
- Blank window or missing content
  - Quit Zeem and start it again. If it persists, reinstall using the latest installer.
- Still stuck?
  - Open an issue on the project’s GitHub with what you tried and any error messages.

## Privacy & data

- Your schedule is stored locally on your computer.
- Zeem does not upload your meetings or links anywhere.
